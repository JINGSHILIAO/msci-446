Failing an encounter does not mean ‘game over’, and no action can be taken back.

Solve issues with diplomacy, delve into occultism to expand your historical and scientific knowledge, or play detective and see what others do not perceive. Your skills will have uses that extend far beyond your conversations with fellow guests. With 15 diverse skills to use and invest in, players are free to uncover The Council’s mysteries how they see fit, with wildly varying consequences depending on their methods. The results will forever alter the life of Louis de Richet, of those around him, and shape history as we know it.","about_the_game":"<img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/287630/extras/banner05.png?t=1603099936\" /><br><br>The Complete Season of The Council grants you access to all 5 episodes.<br><br>The Council is an episodic game like no other.
