I don't think it's a stretch to say that Tidalis is one of the best puzzle game I've ever played. Simply put, if you like puzzle games (and even if you usually don't), you need to get Tidalis. Right now. Go!&quot;<br><strong><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.outofeight.info/2010/07/tidalis-review.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >James Allen, Out of Eight PC Game Reviews</a> (8/8 score)</strong><br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>&quot;Overall, this is the most robust and interesting casual game I have seen in some time. There is so much to do and so many ways to play I don't even know that casual actually suits it. Yes the gameplay is casual but this is a highly developed, well-rounded, offering from Arcen Games that puts many games of higher price to shame. It's got numerous ways to play and very successfully takes an old genre, turns it on its head, and shows you just what can be done when you think outside of the box.&quot;<br><strong><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamersdailynews.com/article-2510-Tidalis-Review-PC-Mac.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Christophor Rick, Gamers Daily News</a> (GDN Gold Award, 9/10 Score)</strong><br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li></ul>","header_image":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/40420/header.jpg?t=1591802519","website":"http://arcengames.com/tidalis/","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP SP2 or later<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 1.4Ghz CPU minimum, 1.8 Ghz recommended for background animation or multiplayer <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 1 GB RAM (2 GB recommended)<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> 800x600 or greater screen resolution (32 bit color, 1280x720 recommended) <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 600 MB<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Other Requirements:</strong> Internet Connection or LAN required for networked multiplayer.
