Improved graphics, more story, better performance, more of everything you love!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Defender's Quest is a Tower-Defense/RPG Hybrid (Think Final Fantasy Tactics meets Tower Defense). It focuses on three things: tactical depth, customization, and story.  That means no random encounters, no spikey-haired emo kids, no forced time sinks, and no tedious, repetitive battles.<br><br>The battle system builds off of tower defense, with individual characters taking the place of towers.  Each character levels-up, learns skills, and equips gear individually, allowing the player to customize their battle experience and strategy.  The overall game structure is similar to &quot;tactical&quot; RPG's, but with a real-time battle system.  Game speed is adjustable, and commands can even be issued while the game is paused.<br><br>It also features an engaging, character-driven story written by an actual English major! The story strives to be fast-paced, snappy, and always relevant to gameplay with minimal exposition. Finally, it's got options and accessibility settings out the wazoo, so that you can have the best possible experience!<br><br>---------<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.defendersquest.com/1/?page=eula\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >End User License Agreement</a>","about_the_game":"Defender's Quest is a Tower-Defense/RPG Hybrid (Think Final Fantasy Tactics meets Tower Defense).
