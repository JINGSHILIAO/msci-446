X4: Foundations is unique in its depth, <strong>simulating an entire universe of NPC ships and stations, forming a realistic economy</strong>. It consists of a huge universe, simulated from the bottom up. Hundreds of stations, and thousands of ships, trade goods among themselves. Prices change based on supply and demand; resources are mined and processed in several stages. This economy is linked directly to the simulation of major conflicts in a universe with dynamically-acting factions. Every player decision can dramatically change the future of the game universe. <strong>Step in and live your very own space adventure!</strong><br><br>X4: Foundations has been significantly enlarged with its <strong>4.0 Update</strong> – this is the perfect time for space game enthusiasts to newly discover or revisit the biggest space sandbox this side of the galaxy! Jump into your ship and experience <strong>completely new features</strong> such as Terraforming, new options for managing hostilities, improved fleet control, and a new emergency eject feature. On the technical side, the 4.00 update brings volumetric fog effects, improves the fading-in of asteroids, and adds a visual shield impact effect.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392160/extras/gif_fight.gif?t=1644251058\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Start your journey</strong><br>In X4, you can start your journey from <strong>a number of different gamestarts</strong> and as a number of different characters, each with their own role, set of relationships and different ships and technologies to start with.

Stations can be constructed from a variety of modules, be it production modules, living sections, docks or many other types of parts.
