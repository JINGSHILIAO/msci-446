But as you dig deeper, SPAZ becomes much more.  <br>\t\t\t\t\t\tInstead of flying a single ship, you are in charge of an ever growing and evolving fleet, unlocking the rich tactical elements of SPAZ, all accessed at the touch of a button.  Issue orders, change ships, apply fleet AI settings, all on the fly.  At any moment the battle can change, and the Tactics Panel gives you the tools to make the battle turn in your favor.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\tAs a layer on top of the action and tactics, we have a detailed technology and levelup system akin to what you would expect from an RPG.  Learn to build new ships by destroying your enemies.  Explore the galaxy to find components, use your hard earned research points to unlock their potential, and then customize every aspect of your new fleet.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\tFinally, there is the universe in which all this strife and adventure takes place.  SPAZ features a persistent randomly generated Galaxy populated with story elements, factions, enemies, missions, items, to provide you with a unique experience each time you play.
