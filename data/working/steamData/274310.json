We are the masters of our destinies, Always Sometimes Monsters says – but we can't control other people's lives. That's where it gets tricky.”<br>4/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.joystiq.com/2014/06/03/always-sometimes-monsters-review-being-human/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Joystiq</a><br><br>“It's an earnest look at life under tough economic pressure, at love when things don't go according to plan and at a creative career during its shittiest lows. It has a lot to say, and importantly, it speaks from the heart.”<br>8/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/5/5765838/always-sometimes-monsters-review-working-class-hero\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Polygon</a><br><br>“Always Sometimes Monsters isn't the first game to get clever with morality. It's not the first game that's had a few grey areas. It also isn't about either of those. It's about perspective. It's about empathy. It's about who we are and why we do what we do. That narrative is one of contradiction and hypocrisy, because that's what real people are about.”<br>9/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-05-21-always-sometimes-monsters-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Eurogamer</a><br>","header_image":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/274310/header.jpg?t=1623263497","website":"http://alwayssometimesmonsters.com","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP, Vista, 7, or 8 (32-bit or 64-bit)<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Pentium 4, 2.0 Ghz or faster<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 512 MB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> 1024 x 768 desktop resolution or better<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 500 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> No Steam Overlay Support</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> OSX 10.7<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2000 MB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> OpenGL 2.0 capable graphics card<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 500 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Steam Achievements not supported, Steam Overlay enabled</li></ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Ubuntu 12.04<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2000 MB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> OpenGL 2.0 capable graphics card<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 500 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Steam Achievements not supported</li></ul>"},"legal_notice":"Copyright © Vagabond Dog 2013.
