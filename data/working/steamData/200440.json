In addition to an  archipelago filled with new vegetation in which players can traverse whether by foot, on horseback, sailing their own boat or even by swimming, there is also all-new races and bosses who lurk in the depths of the unexplored islands. Brilliantly flavored with stunning new cut-scenes, the 12+ hours of main quests await the player, permeated with twists and surprises at every decision. Dozens of new weapons including the crossbow, permanent potions and new armor accessories to increase the hero’s stats, effective horse armor, as well as fresh fighting techniques will provide the perfect means to get an all-new experience in the world of Antaloor.
