Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOriginally published episodically over a span of years, the game now includes all five acts along with the &quot;interludes,&quot; which were originally published separately. It has also been painstakingly localized for French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish (both European Spanish and Latin American).","about_the_game":"At twilight in Kentucky, as bird songs give way to the choir of frogs and insects, familiar roads become strange, and it's easy to get lost.

Be warned though; it’ll leave you hungry for unknown roads and longing for an invitation to the blues.&quot;<br><a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/01/11/wot-i-think-kentucky-route-zero-act-i/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a><br><br>&quot;Evokes the feeling of old ghost stories told around a campfire. There's the familiarity of friends and family around a warm, man-made fire, but with it comes the unnerving tale of the strange and unusual.
