The floating system and driving models are based on physics: each turn, slope, hard braking, acceleration, each turn and twist of the track will apply a unique force to the ship. A sharp low-polygon style blends meshes and terrains with the latest state-of-the-art shading and lighting effects provided by the <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong>, creating beautiful and instantly recognisable aesthetics. Breezy coastlines, eerie frozen landscapes, vast desert plains: the melancholic, dystopian atmosphere of a semi abandoned Earth is the background for the most high-speed, tense and beautiful futuristic racing clashes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><u>Features</u></strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Online multiplayer - match against 12 players around the world for a real challenge<br></li><li>Optional VR Support - Oculus Rift, HTC Vive or OSVR.

It's not about the numbers you see on screen, it's about the vibrations, the landscape and buildings flying by, the high-speed collisions, the effects, the sounds, the immersion: everything is meant to feel like you're going FAST.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><u>Online Multiplayer</u></strong></h2>Challenge up to 12 players from all over the world and find out who's the best Redout pilot in history!

Redout enhances your experience and transcends visuals, immersing yourself in a mixture of sounds and music that adapts to your playstyle and your performance on the track.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><u>Immersive VR</u></strong></h2>We have been working hard to give you the best VR game yet.

Redout features believable physics derived from quad-copters controllers and real magnetic forces. We came up with the next generation in AG handling. There's always a way to face a corner without braking, but you have to prepare for it and use everything you've got. Steer, strafe and turbo out of a corner are the basics: upgrades and powerups will grant you even more control on your ship's behaviour. You'll need to dominate your ship before you face the advanced tracks.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><u>Thriving Discord Community</u></strong></h2>Whatever you are in for a casual multiplayer match or just for some chitchatting during a break, the official Discord server is there for you: <strong><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://discord.me/redout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >https://discord.me/redout</a></strong>!
