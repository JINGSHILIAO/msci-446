The faster the benchmark runs, the better your score. Now your quest begins. What can you do to get a better score?<br><br>Start by comparing your 3DMark score with results from other systems with the same hardware. Lower than average scores may indicate a problem with cooling, configuration, or faulty components. Higher than average scores show the potential for overclocking your hardware.
