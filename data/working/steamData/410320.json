phenomenon that &quot;Armor value&quot; or &quot;Acquisition of weapons&quot; of save data is tampered when playing online multi play with specific players</h1><p>We deeply apologize for any inconvenience this time.\r\nWe have got some reports about the title above.\r\n\r\nWe investigated about it and verified the same phenomenon.\r\nWhen we played online multi play with specific players who are called cheaters and tamper their game data, our save data became aberrant by obtaining tampered items after the mission.\r\n\r\nWe will keep investigating about malicious data tampering, but for now, once your save data is tampered, it is impossible to get your data back again.\r\nWe would appreciate for your understanding.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround for customers, since this phenomenon is caused by playing online play with cheaters and completing missions, if you find any cheaters or players who are suspected as cheaters in the online room, we deeply recommend you to leave the room as soon as possible without launching the mission.\r\n\r\nIn addition, if you find any cheaters or players who are suspected as cheaters during the mission, we also recommend you to leave the mission before you complete it.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>It's a fight for the future of the planet between the Ravagers, a merciless swarm of alien invaders, and the Earth Defense Force (EDF) in this third-person shooter.\r\n\r\nAs an EDF soldier you will go head to head in fierce combat against the hordes of giant alien insects and their slaughtering machines.\r\n\r\nPlay as four different classes in over 80 missions with a range of 800 weapons at your disposal.\r\n\r\nThe most overwhelmingly numerous forces of Ravagers the series has ever seen will take the EDF fighters to the depths
