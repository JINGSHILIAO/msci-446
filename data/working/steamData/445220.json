All you know is that the Event also spawned multiple untraversable hyperspace rifts throughout the entire galaxy and that a strange race of aliens, the Xsotan, has appeared in the center. It looks like these aliens have found a way to cross over the torn hyperspace fabric, but so far nobody has managed to establish contact with them.<br><br>There are also rumors about a strange new metal called ‘Avorion’ which has appeared in the center of the galaxy around the same time as the Xsotan have arrived. Apparently, the aliens use this material to build their ships.<br><br>Start out as a nobody at the edge and work your way to the center of a galaxy that gets more dangerous, but also more rewarding the closer you get to its core. Avorion takes sandbox aspects from games like X or Freelancer, throws in co-op multiplayer and lets you build your own ships. It features ships made of freely scalable blocks that can be procedurally generated and that break into pieces where they're hit in space fights.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/445220/extras/combat.png?t=1631020795\" /><br>Equip your ship with chainguns, lasers and other weaponry to take on your enemies and enjoy the sight of completely destructible ships breaking at the exact points where you hit them. <br><br>Defend your allies from pirates, hunt down enemies for coin or even participate in wars between entire factions. Once you’re victorious, collect loot from defeated foes which you can use to upgrade your ship: new turrets with special abilities like autofire or repair beams, or system upgrades that allow you to install even more weapons.

Each faction has its own characteristics, such as peaceful, intelligent or aggressive, and its ships and stations have a distinct look.<br><br>Explore the galaxy at your own pace to find valuable goods in old ship wrecks, undiscovered asteroid fields rich in resources, gigantic asteroids which you can claim for yourself, or clues about what happened during the Event a few centuries back.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/445220/extras/buildYourFleet.png?t=1631020795\" /><br>There are no limits to the size or complexity of your ship besides your resources.

But always keep an eye on your ship’s maneuverability and energy requirements. Adjust your ship perfectly to its operational purpose: everything from light and agile explorers to heavily armored battleships with strong shields.<br><br>And why build only one ship? Hire captains to fly your ships for you, manage your crews, weapons, hangars and fighters and build your own fleet of spaceships!<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/445220/extras/trade.png?t=1631020795\" /><br>Extend your ship with a cargo bay, find profitable deals and haul over a hundred trading goods across the galaxy to make a profit and buy your way up the food chain. Constructing a fleet of specialized transport ships with lots of cargo space will help you build up a trading corporation. <br><br>Extend your influence in the galaxy by founding asteroid mines and factories that attract NPC traders who will buy and sell their goods at your establishments.
