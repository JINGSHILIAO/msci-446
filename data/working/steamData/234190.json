One, it focuses on a single weapon, the Colt 1911 A1, and takes it very seriously, using &quot;high detail gun mechanics&quot;, which means you can &quot;manipulate each part of the gun independently&quot; (the beginning of the video shows this in action). The second is that it's a randomly-generated shooter that features permanent death. Taking place inside a single building, every time you die, you have to start at the very beginning again, but the entire game world is re-rolled. It's available now for $5, which given the ideas on show, is totally worth it just to check it out.&quot;<br>– <a href=\"http://kotaku.com/5919788/the-shooter-that-changes-every-time-you-die\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Kotaku</a><br><br>&quot;Receiver didn’t cast me as some nigh-invincible mass of regenerating muscle. The end result, then, was that I felt exactly how I’d expect Real Me would in a combat situation involving live ammo.&quot;<br>– <a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/06/20/impressions-wolfires-hyper-realistic-gun-sim-receiver/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock Paper Shotgun</a>","header_image":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/234190/header.jpg?t=1586267903","website":"http://www.wolfire.com/receiver","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong>Windows XP<br>\t</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>2.0 GHz<br>\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>1 GB RAM<br>\t</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>Passmark G3D 250+<br>\t</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong>150 MB HD space</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong>Windows 7<br>\t</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>2.0 GHz<br>\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>2 GB RAM<br>\t</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>Passmark G3D 1000+<br>\t</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong>150 MB HD space</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong>10.6<br>\t</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>2.0 GHz<br>\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>1 GB RAM<br>\t</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>Passmark G3D 250+<br>\t</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong>150 MB HD space</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong>10.6<br>\t</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>2.0 GHz<br>\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>2 GB RAM<br>\t</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>Passmark G3D 1000+<br>\t</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong>150 MB HD space</li></ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong>Ubuntu 12.10<br>\t</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>2.0 GHz<br>\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>1 GB RAM<br>\t</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>Passmark G3D 250+<br>\t</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong>150 MB HD space</li></ul>"},"developers":["Wolfire Games"],"price_overview":{"currency":"CAD","initial":569,"final":569,"discount_percent":0,"initial_formatted":"","final_formatted":"CDN$ 5.69"},"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"}],"genres":[{"id":"1","description":"Action"},{"id":"23","description":"Indie"},{"id":"28","description":"Simulation"}]}}}
