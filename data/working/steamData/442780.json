This is what STRAFE® isn't:<br> <br><br><strong>+ STRAFE® is not a traditional shooter or a &quot;Quake Clone&quot; </strong> - STRAFE®  pays homage to many classic shooters, and it features many of the classic elements of old school shooters but STRAFE® is a roguelike. This means that it was designed from the ground up for replayability and randomization. Every room in STRAFE® was designed by hand and is seamlessly connected by our level generator to create unique experiences.<br><br><strong>+ STRAFE® does not have lives or checkpoints</strong> - As a roguelike, if you die in STRAFE® you will start at the beginning of the game and everything will randomize. The game is balanced around this idea to avoid frustration. <br><br><strong>+ STRAFE® is not a multiplayer game</strong> - There is no multiplayer deathmatch or co-op in STRAFE®. But we recommend Quake Live if you are looking for a great old school arena shooter. <br><br><strong>+ STRAFE® is not limited to the design decisions of 1996</strong> - What can I say? We are ahead of our time. STRAFE® is a mix of old and new design. We didn't want to not imitate the games of the past but instead invoke the feeling of them while bringing fresh ideas to the table. We aim to bring you something new with STRAFE®. <br><br><strong>+ STRAFE® tries new things with the roguelike FPS formula</strong> - We aim to generate full levels that feel more natural to explore and avoid patterns of rooms that lock you in, teleport in enemies and force you to kill them before the doors unlock. We want STRAFE® to feel like a seamless adventure from start to finish. <br><br><strong>+ STRAFE® is not a game that will run well on older computers or laptops</strong> - STRAFE® may look older but it's a new game and features some cutting edge tech. Please check the min spec!<br><br><br>STRAFE® may look like a game you've played but we've worked hard to create a unique and fresh take on first person shooters, we hope you enjoy it!","about_the_game":"<strong>SURGEON GENERAL’S WARNING: The Surgeon General was brutally murdered by STRAFE®. </strong><br><br>STRAFE® is a roguelike first-person shooter that generates unique, full levels every time you play.
