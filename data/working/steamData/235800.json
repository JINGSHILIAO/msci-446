Enhanced graphics quality. Ability to search for music. Available on Mac and Linux!<br><br><br><strong>What’s new about Mono mode in Audiosurf 2?</strong><br><br>In Audiosurf 2 your timing in mono mode is more important than ever. You’ve got to strategize to get your grid full at the most intense moments of songs to get the most points. Look ahead in the distance for corkscrew loops with powerups to know when these moments will occur.<br><br><br><strong>What do I get in the demo?</strong><br><br>The demo allows players to play any song they want, for their first 3 songs. After that, they can play the Song of the Day, everyday, as many times as they want.<br><br><br><strong>Is there a mode that focuses on dodging blocks?</strong><br><br>Yes, there's a new Ninja mode. It has a big bonus for hitting no spikes and creates intense spike fields to weave through. It’s faster than regular Mono and the second-to-second challenge of avoiding spikes is harder. For even more challenge there’s ninja turbo.
