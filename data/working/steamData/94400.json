Use a variety of fencing maneuvers while armed -- lunges, parries, and even dirty tricks like throwing your sword.  If swordless, press forward with punches, sweep kicks, dive kicks, rolls, and wall jumps. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe combat arena stretches in both directions, although besting an opponent only gains you ground. Matches aren’t won or lost with a single kill, but with a series of kills granting you right-of-way to run/fight/flee to your own goal-zone. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach arena holds different strategic formations and chokepoints to use to your advantage.
