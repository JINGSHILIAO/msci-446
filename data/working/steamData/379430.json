The death of its beloved ruler, Emperor Charles IV, has plunged the kingdom into dark times: war, corruption, and discord are tearing this jewel of the Holy Roman Empire apart.<br><br>One of Charles' sons, Wenceslas, has inherited the crown. Unlike his father, Wenceslas is a naive, self-indulgent, unambitious monarch. His half-brother and King of Hungary, Sigismund the Red Fox, senses weakness in Wenceslas.

With no king on the throne, Sigismund is now free to plunder Bohemia and seize its riches.<br><br>In the midst of this chaos, you're Henry, the son of a blacksmith.
