Influences and borrowings be damned – it stands alone and is as brilliantly designed, challenging and cunning a package of ideas and aesthetic choices as anything I’ve seen this year.”<br>Wot I Think – <a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/10/31/review-dungeon-of-the-endless\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a><br><br>“Don’t be fooled by the simplicity of its pixels: no individual element of Dungeon of the Endless is especially complicated, but together they form a fiendish and unforgiving challenge. If you’re willing to take that on then it makes it more than worthwhile, borrowing from several genres to create something that feels unique - as well as bursting with personality and smart choices.”<br>8.1/10 – <a href=\"http://uk.ign.com/articles/2014/11/13/dungeon-of-the-endless-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >IGN</a><br><br>“From its setting to its design and aesthetic, Dungeon of the Endless feels like a game built for me. It’s tough and unforgiving, but it’s also fair. Despite all the deaths I spent climbing through the dungeon’s floors, I slowly mastered the game. That’s a testament to the roguelike genre, and it’s why I like tangling with it so much.”<br>4.5/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/dungeon-of-the-endless\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Game Revolution</a><br>","header_image":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/249050/header.jpg?t=1642780301","website":"http://www.amplitude-studios.com/dungeon-of-the-endless","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows Vista / 7 / 8 / 8.1<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo or equivalent<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce 8600 GT or equivalent<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 9.0c<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 700 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> DirectX 9 Compatible Audio<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Minimum Resolution: 1280 x 720</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows Vista / 7 / 8 / 8.1<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 3.3 GHz Intel Core i5 or equivalent<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 Ti or equivalent<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 9.0c<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 700 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> DirectX 9 Compatible Audio<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Minimum Resolution: 1280 x 720</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> MAC OS X 10.8 to 10.12<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo or equivalent<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> AMD Radeon HD 2600, NVidia GeForce 9400 or equivalent<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 700 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Minimum Resolution: 1280 x 720</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> MAC OS X 10.8 to 10.12<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 3.2 GHz Intel Core i3 or equivalent<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> AMD Radeon HD 4670, NVidia GeForce GT 330 or equivalent<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 700 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Minimum Resolution: 1280 x 720</li></ul>"},"linux_requirements":[],"legal_notice":"© 2017 Amplitude Studios.
