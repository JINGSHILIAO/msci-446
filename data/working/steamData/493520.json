The Rundown is a series of expeditions, each one taking you deeper into a decayed research facility called the Complex.

It’s for players that value a serious challenge.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A 4-player cooperative experience</h2>GTFO is designed for prisoner teams of four, putting cooperation at the core of the experience. Bots can fill your lineup if you’re short one or two players. They’ll follow you through expeditions, sneak when you sneak, collect resources, and fight alongside you. They're a good fallback, but the level of communication and tactical combat in GTFO means it's best to play with people.  <br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/493520/extras/02_steam.gif?t=1645458757\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Prepare, Explore, Survive</h2>A strategy is necessary to clear the Rundown.
