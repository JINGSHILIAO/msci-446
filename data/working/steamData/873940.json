It came out of nowhere, flying under my radar and sneakily placing itself in my 2019’s top 10 list.”<br>9,5/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.strategyinformer.com/reviews/crying-suns-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Strategy Informer</a><br><br>“Crying Suns does right by its predecessors, all while carving out its own space in the genre.
