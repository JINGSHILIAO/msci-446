Each turn, you must decide where to go, how to scavenge for supplies, and how to deal with anything and anyone you encounter. And with each passing minute, the pit in your stomach grows, your dehydration worsens, your muscles tire, and your body temperature drops in the cold autumn air. Choose your starting abilities carefully, because they and your wit are the only tools you have in the apocalypse!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Unique Setting</strong> - Near-future, post-apocalyptic Michigan with local cryptids and folklore.
