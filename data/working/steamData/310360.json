The music, backgrounds and characters work together to create a world that is the stage of a novel for the user to read. They laugh and cry and get angry. The user takes the point of view of the protagonist to experience the story.","supported_languages":"English, Japanese","reviews":"“Nearly everything about this game’s story just works. It leans from the most asinine, youthful banter possible to truly twisted mental states by the end. Players will end up second guessing themselves just as much as the protagonist does.”<br>4.5/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2015/05/22/review-higurashi-when-they-cry-hou-ch-1-onikakushi/149971/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Hardcore Gamer</a><br><br>“Higurashi stands out as an example of how evocative a game can be based on storytelling without the aid of high-end graphics.”<br>8.5/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://apgnation.com/articles/2015/05/29/17237/higurashi-onikakushi-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >APG Nation</a><br>","header_image":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/310360/header.jpg?t=1589502078","website":"http://www.mangagamer.org/07thExpansion/","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP, 7, 8<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Pentium III 800 MHz<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 512 MB RAM<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 9.0<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 500 MB available space</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Pentium 4 1.4GHz<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 1 GB RAM</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> OSX 10.8: &quot;Mountain Lion&quot;<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 1 Ghz or faster processor<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 512 MB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 500 MB available space</li></ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Ubuntu or equivalent<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 1 Ghz or faster processor<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 512 MB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 500 MB available space</li></ul>"},"legal_notice":"(c)07th Expansion / MangaGamer","developers":["07th Expansion"],"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"},{"id":22,"description":"Steam Achievements"},{"id":29,"description":"Steam Trading Cards"},{"id":23,"description":"Steam Cloud"}],"genres":[{"id":"25","description":"Adventure"}]}}}
