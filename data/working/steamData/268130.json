From there, you've got to sneak up on the crew, outshoot them in slowmo gunfights, or outthink them with clever gadgets. Take missions to steal loot, assassinate VIPs, or rescue friends.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/268130/extras/spacer.png?t=1584742422\" /><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/268130/extras/pause_combat_gif_2.png?t=1584742422\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Take your time!</h2>Get out of impossible situations by pausing at any time and taking as long as you need to figure out a clever plan.

Rip a ship in half. Get sucked into space by the vacuum.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Rescue your friends' characters!</h2>If someone on your friends list gets their character captured, and they aren't able to rescue them, maybe you can! You'll sometimes get a character whose personal goal is to rescue a friend's character. If you manage it, you unlock your friend's character to play as! They don't get it back. They had their chance. It's yours now.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Find your friends' items!</h2>When you retire an accomplished character, you can choose one item to pass on.

So here's what it isn't:<br><br>-<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>It's not story-driven: there's a backstory to this place and a few conversations with characters, but there's not a story that develops as you play. It's much more about the stories you generate by playing, about how you got out of impossible situation X or pulled off crazy stunt Y.<br><br></li><li>There aren't other careers: You can't mine asteroids. You can't build ships. You can't recruit a crew. You're an infiltrator, you break into spaceships for a living, it's all about that.<br><br></li><li>There are no planets: The whole game takes place in this nebula full of space stations. You can dock at any friendly station and board any hostile ship, but it's not a space exploration game.<br><br></li><li>It's not multiplayer: The friends features mentioned above are fun but they're just sharing content, it's not multiplayer at all and you're never in the same world together.</li></ul><br>There are cool games about all those things.
