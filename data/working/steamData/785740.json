The developers have taken what they learnt from the original game and improved on everything from the story to the core gameplay mechanics.”<br>9.2/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamepitt.co.uk/this-is-the-police-2-pc-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GamePitt</a><br><br>“A veritable Matryoshka doll of dark delights, executed to perfection. The turn based combat completely engrosses and could have been a game on its own, but Weappy went the extra mile: they delivered one of the darkest, truest video game narratives of the year.”<br>95 % – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://ragequit.gr/reviews/item/this-is-the-police-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >RAGEquit</a><br><br>“It has all the drama you’d want, all the corruption you’d ask for, and the same gameplay as the first, but expanded upon to make it much more enjoyable.
