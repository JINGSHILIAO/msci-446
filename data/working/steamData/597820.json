Not only is it downright adorable, but it's also an absolute blast to play. Developer Experiment 101 has created a world that you want to explore, and it frequently rewards you for slowing down and taking it all in. Throw in some great combat, robust character creation, and a wonderful crafting system and you've got a game that should please even the most jaded of open-world enthusiasts.”<br>4.5/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/biomutant-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >We Got This Covered</a><br><br>“For the first time in a long time, a game has lived up (and in my opinion surpassed) the hyped that’s been created around it. Frankly, I’ll be surprised if BIOMUTANT is not game of the year.”<br>9.5/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.gamespace.com/featured/biomutant-review-an-absolute-masterpiece/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GameSpace</a><br><br>“Considering Biomutant’s delayed and seemingly troubled road to release, I’m blindsided by just how good it is. Experiment 101 has clearly been afforded the time to see its vision through, something which is unfortunately far too rare in the cutthroat gaming industry. I did not expect this to be one of my favorites of the year so far, let alone one of the most enjoyable open-world games I’ve ever played. A true modern gaming miracle.”<br>9.5/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.gamerevolution.com/review/681289-biomutant-review-pc-ps4-ps5-xbox-series-x-worth-buying\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Game Revolution</a><br>","header_image":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/597820/header.jpg?t=1642580630","website":null,"pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7/8.1/10 (64 bit)<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> AMD FX-8350 or Intel Core i5-4690K or newer running at 3.5 GHz or higher<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 8 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> 4 GB Direct3D 11 capable video card - GeForce GTX 960 or Radeon R9 380<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 25 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> Integrated or dedicated DirectX 9 compatible soundcard<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Keyboard, mouse and an internet connection for Steam.</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 (64bit)<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> AMD Ryzen 5 1600 or Intel Core i7-6700K or newer running at 3.2 GHz or higher<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> 6 GB Direct3D 11 capable video card - GeForce GTX 1660Ti or Radeon RX 590<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 25 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> Integrated or dedicated DirectX 9 compatible soundcard<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Keyboard, mouse and an internet connection for Steam</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li></ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li></ul>"},"legal_notice":"© 2021 THQ Nordic AB & Experiment 101 AB.
