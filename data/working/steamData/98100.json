{"98100":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Trauma","steam_appid":98100,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"<strong>TRAUMA</strong> tells a story of a young woman who survives a car accident. Recovering at the hospital, she has dreams that shed light on different aspects of her identity - such as the way she deals with the loss of her parents. TRAUMA lets you experience those dreams in an interactive way, reminiscent of Point-and-Click Adventure Games. It builds upon this established formula by introducing a gesture-based interface, real-time 3D technology for dynamic level layouts, unique photographic visuals and a level design philosophy that focuses on creating a rich experience rather than an elaborate puzzle challenge. Combined with the unconventional story, it is aimed to be a compact and deep game for a literate and mature audience.","about_the_game":"<strong>TRAUMA</strong> tells a story of a young woman who survives a car accident.
