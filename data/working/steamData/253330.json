Make no mistake, it's still a horror game first and foremost, but that extra little bit of dark knowledge is unsettling. The terror feels more real, more concrete, than any other horror game I've played in recent memory.”<br>7/10 – <a href=\"http://www.destructoid.com/review-neverending-nightmares-282258.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Destructoid</a><br>","header_image":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/253330/header.jpg?t=1602322333","website":"http://www.neverendingnightmares.com/","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 1.7GHz Intel/AMD CPU<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 1 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> OpenGL 2.0 compliant video card<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 500 MB available space</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> OS X 10.7 or later<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 1.7GHz Intel/AMD CPU<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 1 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> OpenGL 2.0 compliant video card<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 500 MB available space</li></ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Ubuntu 12.04 or later<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 1.7GHz Intel/AMD CPU<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 1 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> OpenGL 2.0 compliant video card<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 500 MB available space</li></ul>"},"developers":["Infinitap Games"],"price_overview":{"currency":"CAD","initial":1699,"final":424,"discount_percent":75,"initial_formatted":"CDN$ 16.99","final_formatted":"CDN$ 4.24"},"metacritic":{"score":68,"url":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/neverending-nightmares?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f"},"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"},{"id":22,"description":"Steam Achievements"},{"id":28,"description":"Full controller support"},{"id":29,"description":"Steam Trading Cards"},{"id":13,"description":"Captions available"},{"id":23,"description":"Steam Cloud"},{"id":43,"description":"Remote Play on TV"}],"genres":[{"id":"1","description":"Action"},{"id":"25","description":"Adventure"},{"id":"23","description":"Indie"}]}}}
