Art, music, breadth of content, game length -- La-Mulana gets the highest marks. But there's simply no denying that the difficulty, as fair as Nigoro purports it to be, is a major deterrent. If you are willing to suffer, though, you will be blown away. I guarantee it.&quot;<br>8/10 – <a href=\"http://www.destructoid.com/review-la-mulana-remake--232174.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Destructoid </a><br><br>&quot;Nigoro’s La-Mulana is like Castlevania: Symphony of The Night spliced with Dark Souls. It is long, it is tough, it is involved and it has puzzles that’ll make your brain bleed.&quot;<br>93/100 – <a href=\"http://www.indiegamemag.com/la-mulana-review/#.UE_rjfm0MxQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Indie Game Mag</a><br><br>&quot;I look back on my time with La-Mulana with plenty of frustration at the challenging platforming, enemies, bosses, and puzzles.
