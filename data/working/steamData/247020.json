In fact, I probably ended up spending more time with Cook, Serve, Delicious! than with almost any other game this year. The gameplay is simple in nature but blisteringly fast, resulting in a challenge that is more than enough to keep the average player interested. The game does not overstay its welcome, as it evolves in numerous ingenious ways by the time you’ve reached the end.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://thestereogram.com/2013/02/cook-serve-delicious-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Stereogram</a><br><br>“It's not an easy game to excel at, but it's an easy game to get hooked on, and the challenge of building and running your own restaurant from front to back is going to captivate you for weeks on end...with depth to rival a strategy game and carefully controlled chaos ruling the action sequences, Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a rare release that encourages you to play until you master every nuance of gameplay.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://jayisgames.com/archives/2012/11/cook_serve_delicious.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Jay Is Games</a><br><br>“Cook, Serve, Delicious! is fast paced, engaging, and absolutely addictive for foodies or non-foodies alike.
