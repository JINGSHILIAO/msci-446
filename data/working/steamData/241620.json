Its fun, difficult, and it has a lot of content.”<br>90% – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gripyajoystick.com/inquisitor-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GripYaJoystick</a><br><br>“True to its name, Inquisitor is about a lot more than simply running around killing monsters and leveling up. It has a deep, complex story, and how much of it you uncover will be directly related to how you choose to interact with the people you encounter.”<br>80% – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gripyajoystick.com/inquisitor-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >SnackbarGames</a><br><br>“In the end, Inquisitor is a bit like an old school RPG holy water : faithful worshippers see it as a consecration and a benediction, less motivated believers handle it with more or less indifference, but heretics and possessed will cry out in pain when touching it. Nonetheless, it is definitely a ceremonial jewel that promises a unique, visceral and generous experience. An experience that stands out from nowaday's video game scene with its anti-consensual, challenging but rewarding approach.”<br>90% – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.rpgfrance.com/test-10013-1-test-inquisitor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >RPG France</a><br>","header_image":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/241620/header.jpg?t=1614543492","website":"http://inquisitor-rpg.com/","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP/Vista/7/8<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Single Core 1.6 GHz<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 512 MB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> 3D graphics card supporting DirectX with 64 MB of memory<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2300 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> A compatible sound card</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP/Vista/7/8<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Dual Core 2 GHz<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 1 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> 3D graphics card supporting DirectX with 256 MB of memory<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2300 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> A compatible sound card</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"legal_notice":"1999-2021 © CINEMAX, s.r.o.","developers":["CINEMAX, s.r.o."],"price_overview":{"currency":"CAD","initial":999,"final":339,"discount_percent":66,"initial_formatted":"CDN$ 9.99","final_formatted":"CDN$ 3.39"},"metacritic":{"score":64,"url":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/inquisitor?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f"},"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"},{"id":29,"description":"Steam Trading Cards"}],"genres":[{"id":"23","description":"Indie"},{"id":"3","description":"RPG"}]}}}
