Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457140/extras/ONI_GIF_04_EnhanceEfficiencyThroughGas.gif?t=1639689037\" /><br>Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations:</h2>Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base.
