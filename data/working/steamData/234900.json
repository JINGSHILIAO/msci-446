At its core, Anodyne is about alienation from the real world, particularly for gamers.&quot;<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.polygon.com/2013/3/18/4100356/anodyne-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Polygon</a><br><br>&quot;Anodyne can be as funny and charming as Link’s Awakening on occasion, but the overall tone is one of unease, with a subtle malevolence – the ‘something seems a bit off here’ factor – reminiscent of the indie horror Lone Survivor. Meaning is elusive, but themes and motifs soon begin to take form, in a game that feels increasingly personal the more you burrow into it.&quot;<br><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/review/anodyne-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >PC Gamer</a> - 84/100","header_image":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/234900/header.jpg?t=1630303125","website":"http://www.anodynegame.com","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong>Windows XP<br>\t</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>1.5 GHz, single core<br>\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>1 GB RAM<br>\t</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>Any<br>\t</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong>100 MB HD space<br>\t</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong>Any<br>\t</li><li><strong>Additional:</strong>This is not a GPU-intensive game.</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong>Windows XP or better<br>\t</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>(2.0 GHz, single core) or better<br>\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>2 GB RAM<br>\t</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>Any<br>\t</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong>100 MB HD space<br>\t</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong>Any<br>\t</li><li><strong>Additional:</strong>This is not a GPU-intensive game.</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong>10.6 or Newer<br>\t</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>Intel 1.5 Ghz, single core<br>\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>1 GB RAM<br>\t</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>Any<br>\t</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong>150 MB HD space<br>\t</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong>Any<br>\t</li><li><strong>Additional:</strong>This is not a GPU-intensive game.</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong>10.6 or Newer<br>\t</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>(Intel 2.0 GHz, single core) or better<br>\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>2 GB RAM<br>\t</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>Any<br>\t</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong>150 MB HD space<br>\t</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong>Any<br>\t</li><li><strong>Additional:</strong>This is not a GPU-intensive game.</li></ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Processor:</strong>1.5 GHz, single core<br>\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>1 GB RAM<br>\t</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>Any<br>\t</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong>100 MB HD space<br>\t</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong>Any<br>\t</li><li><strong>Additional:</strong> Requires Adobe AIR 2.6 to be installed (installer scripts included)<br>\t</li><li><strong>Additional:</strong> Steam Cloud unavailable on Linux</li></ul>"},"developers":["Melos Han-Tani","Marina Kittaka"],"price_overview":{"currency":"CAD","initial":999,"final":999,"discount_percent":0,"initial_formatted":"","final_formatted":"CDN$ 9.99"},"metacritic":{"score":75,"url":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/anodyne?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f"},"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"},{"id":22,"description":"Steam Achievements"},{"id":29,"description":"Steam Trading Cards"},{"id":23,"description":"Steam Cloud"}],"genres":[{"id":"1","description":"Action"},{"id":"25","description":"Adventure"},{"id":"23","description":"Indie"}]}}}
