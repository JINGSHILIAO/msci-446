It’s a the type of game that is addictive and fun and you can easily start playing it at midnight and next thing you know it’s 5:30 am and you have to get the kids up and ready for school in half an hour. [...] This is great in nearly every way and has put itself on a short list for consideration once it’s time for Game of the Year awards. Yes, I went there and you should to.

[...] It’s a feat of technical skill in more ways than one and offers countless hours of dungeon crawling potential. [...] For anyone who enjoys a good adventure or the old LoZ titles, Songbringer is the game for you.”<br>9.2 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.n3rdabl3.com/2017/09/20/193552/songbringer-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >N3rdabl3</a><br><br>“A combination of action RPG and rogue-ish exploration of a wonderfully detailed yet procedurally generated world.
