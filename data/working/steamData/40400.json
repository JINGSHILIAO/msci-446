Which is precisely why it’s incredible… This out-of-the-blue one-man passion project is one of this year’s finest strategy games.&quot;<br>- <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamesradar.com/pc/ai-war/review/ai-war/a-20091005104351651002/g-20091005102715123063\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Alec Meer, PC Gamer UK, November 2009</a><br><br>It’s a balancing act, with your own strength on one side, and the AI’s opinion of you on the other. Piss it off before you’re ready to face it, and you’re going to get squashed. That moment, when you’re finally in a position to turn the tables, is about as glorious as gaming gets.<br>- <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-02-14-ai-war-fleet-command-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Phill Cameron, Eurogamer, February 2011</a><br><br>I think I’ve stumbled across this year’s Really New Thing. There’s a lot of 2009 to go, but I’ll be surprised if anyone else twists the RTS formula this dramatically and this effectively. And I’m hoping it’ll be the Next Big Thing, because it’s big, different, entirely unprecedented and an exciting way to play an RTS.<br>- <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.crispygamer.com/columns/2009-08-13/rush-boom-turtle-and-now-for-something-completely-different.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Tom Chick, Crispy Gamer, August 2009</a><br><br>Having played this title at two distinct points in its life cycle what really stands out is the incredible dedication of Arcen Games in keeping on top of how the game evolves and expands. Even though a great many features have been added and tweaked and refined, it was possible for me to drop back into AI War after more than a year away and not find it to be a confusing mish-mash of feature overload. The post-release support is, quite honestly, the best I’ve seen for any game.<br>- <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.incgamers.com/2011/02/ai-war-light-of-the-spire-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Peter Parrish, IncGamers, February 2011</a><br><br>AI War is, quite simply, the best experience you could have with co-op or single-player real-time strategy in this or any year. It combines grand strategy with emergent AI to form an excellent game perfect for parties and multiplayer. It is easily worth double the price that the developer is selling it at, and anyone with any affinity or taste for strategy games should not miss it. It may be daunting at first, but an excellent tutorial and amazing gameplay mechanics alleviate this into a game that almost anyone can - and should - play.<br>- <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://news.bigdownload.com/2009/11/03/review-a-i-war-fleet-command/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >James Murff, Big Download, November 2009</a>","header_image":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/40400/header.jpg?t=1641758804","website":"http://arcengames.com/ai-war/","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP SP2 or later <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 1.6Ghz CPU (2.4 Ghz recommended, Dual Core strongly recommended for Host)<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Graphics card must support 1024x1024 textures (most 32MB and up graphics cards do), 1024x768 or greater (32 bit color recommended)<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 300MB<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Multiplayer:</strong> Broadband Internet Connection or LAN required for multiplayer.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Mac OSX Intel CPU and &quot;Snow Leopard&quot; 10.6 or later<br>\t</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 1.6Ghz CPU (2.4 Ghz recommended, Dual Core strongly recommended for Host)<br>\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br>\t</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Graphics card must support 1024x1024 textures (most 32MB and up graphics cards do), 1024x768 or greater (32 bit color recommended)<br>\t</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 300MB \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>        </li><li><strong>Multiplayer:</strong> Broadband Internet Connection or LAN required for multiplayer.</li></ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Ubuntu 10.10 or later, although other unsupported distros may very well work<br>\t</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 1.6Ghz CPU (2.4 Ghz recommended, Dual Core strongly recommended for Host)<br>\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br>\t</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Graphics card must support 1024x1024 textures (most 32MB and up graphics cards do), 1024x768 or greater (32 bit color recommended)<br>\t</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 300MB \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>        </li><li><strong>Multiplayer:</strong> Broadband Internet Connection or LAN required for multiplayer.</li></ul>"},"developers":["Arcen Games, LLC"],"demos":[{"appid":40410,"description":""}],"price_overview":{"currency":"CAD","initial":1099,"final":274,"discount_percent":75,"initial_formatted":"CDN$ 10.99","final_formatted":"CDN$ 2.74"},"metacritic":{"score":80,"url":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/ai-war-fleet-command?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f"},"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"},{"id":1,"description":"Multi-player"},{"id":9,"description":"Co-op"},{"id":38,"description":"Online Co-op"},{"id":48,"description":"LAN Co-op"},{"id":27,"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer"},{"id":22,"description":"Steam Achievements"},{"id":29,"description":"Steam Trading Cards"}],"genres":[{"id":"23","description":"Indie"},{"id":"2","description":"Strategy"}]}}}
