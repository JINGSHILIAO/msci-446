It’s seductive. It captures the looming threat of utter annihilation played against the transcendent bliss of unravelling mysteries wrapped in enigmas wrapped in other really, really weird shit. It’s excellent, put simply. The cosmic horror and occult subject matter isn’t just set dressing here – it’s expertly woven into the core of play, and the result is completely absorbing.”<br>Recommended – <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/05/31/cultist-simulator-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a><br><br>“Hauntingly rapturous to play and replay, Cultist Simulator won't let you be the next Jim Jones, but it might just make you the next Torgo.
