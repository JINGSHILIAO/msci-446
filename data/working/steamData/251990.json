It's borderline addictive. It's also likely to make a monster out of you. By the end of my first successful playthrough, I had summarily butchered everyone who even thought about looking at us funny, forced the princess into a continuous state of docility and lied my way through every social encounter possible. Was it evil? Yes. Was it glorious? Definitely.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://indiegames.com/2012/06/review_long_live_the_queen_han.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://indiegames.com/2012/06/review_long_live_the_queen_han.html</a><br><br>“Somehow it never occurred to my princess, whom I’d lovingly crafted into a tense, paranoid warlord, that she shouldn’t empty a box of mysterious mailcandy into her mouth. You would think studying poison and espionage would have saved me from this espionage poison, but instead, a list of other skills, skills I never studied, princess skills, were key to avoiding this fate. I guess that’s the lesson: you can’t build a successful Arya without adding a little Sansa.”<br><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/07/06/now-playing-a-paranoid-battle-princess-in-long-live-the-queen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >PCGamer</a><br><br>“If you’re the sort who can sink your teeth into a full afternoon of tabletop strategy, you’ll be happy here. Long Live The Queen is a slow-paced, cozy evening kind of game, good for folks who like numbers and critical thinking. And death. Pink frosted, chubby cheeked death.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.themarysue.com/long-live-the-queen-game-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Mary Sue</a><br>","header_image":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/251990/header.jpg?t=1568494485","website":"http://www.hanakogames.com/llq.shtml","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> XP, Vista, 7, 8<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 1.2 Ghz<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 256 MB RAM</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> 10.4+</li></ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> x86 or compatible processor</li></ul>"},"developers":["Hanako Games"],"price_overview":{"currency":"CAD","initial":1099,"final":384,"discount_percent":65,"initial_formatted":"CDN$ 10.99","final_formatted":"CDN$ 3.84"},"metacritic":{"score":67,"url":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/long-live-the-queen?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f"},"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"},{"id":22,"description":"Steam Achievements"},{"id":28,"description":"Full controller support"},{"id":29,"description":"Steam Trading Cards"}],"genres":[{"id":"23","description":"Indie"},{"id":"3","description":"RPG"},{"id":"28","description":"Simulation"},{"id":"2","description":"Strategy"}]}}}
