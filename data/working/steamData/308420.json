Dungeon crawling and RPG/Roguelike elements are added into the mix, resulting in a fun, challenging and varied game, with lots of content to discover.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFight almighty bosses, get through rooms filled with traps, and treasures that may help you in your journey... Each game is a whole new experience! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnlike most Rogue-thingies, on Ziggurat your combat skills will be the most important asset to keep advancing. Leveling up and randomly generated content is there to improve variety and make each game different, not to make the game a roll dice or an unbearable grind.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost perks are designed to change the way you have to play or the weapons you'll want to use.

No number game here, simple and direct choices.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe've also ensured that, as a proper FPS game, the experience is quick and direct. There's no inventory to manage or the need to compare two almost equal item drops, just weapon selection, and mana/health are usually the bargaining chip.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA whole arsenal of magic and alchemic weapons will be at your disposal. Wreak havoc among your enemies, but watch your mana reserves or you might regret it later!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMagic staves, spellbooks, magic wands... dozens of weapons with different attack strategies that help keeping the game fresh!","about_the_game":"Dungeon-Crawling First Person Shooting at its finest!
