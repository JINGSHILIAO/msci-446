A small band of Norse warriors lands on the shores of England. History may have forgotten their names, but their actions live on. As the chieftain of your clan, let ambition guide your choices in the party-based RPG Expeditions: Viking. How will history remember you?","supported_languages":"English<strong>*</strong>, French, German, Polish, Russian, Danish<br><strong>*</strong>languages with full audio support","reviews":"“Expeditions: Viking spins an absolutely wonderful tale of exploration and conquest. The setting, the story, the ambiance –my imagination ran wild in ways you’d expect to experience reading a good fantasy novel. Betrayal angered me, new friendships elated me, and changing the balance of power in Britain made me feel equal parts devious and mischievous. Reconstructing my home, making it safe, strong and prosperous made me feel proud of my achievements. Every battle, every camp site and map scrubbed clean of its hidden treasures felt like it played a part in the grand scheme of things. There aren’t a lot of games that can pull something like this off even adequately. Expeditions: Vikings does it masterfully.”<br>9/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.hookedgamers.com/pc/expeditions_viking/review/article-1795.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Hooked Gamers</a><br><br>“I’d recommend this game to anyone with a passing interest in tactical RPGs, and anyone who looked at Torment: Tides of Numenera and went, “this is bloody amazing.” Expeditions: Viking doesn’t make it feel good to be bad, but it doesn’t have to. It proves that being responsible is hardly the dullard’s choice when it comes to honouring Odin, and after all, history won’t remember you at all if you don’t live long enough to win.”<br>8/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2017/05/review-expeditions-viking-pc.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2017/05/review-expeditions-viking-pc.html</a><br>","header_image":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/445190/header.jpg?t=1590662666","website":"http://expeditionsseries.com","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core2 Quad Q9400 2.66 GHz<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce GTS 450<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 12 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> DirectX Compatible Sound Card</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i7 3.4GHz<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 8 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Nvidia GTX 660<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 12 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> DirectX Compatible Sound Card</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li></ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li></ul>"},"developers":["Logic Artists"],"price_overview":{"currency":"CAD","initial":3299,"final":3299,"discount_percent":0,"initial_formatted":"","final_formatted":"CDN$ 32.99"},"metacritic":{"score":74,"url":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/expeditions-viking?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f"},"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"},{"id":22,"description":"Steam Achievements"},{"id":29,"description":"Steam Trading Cards"},{"id":23,"description":"Steam Cloud"}],"genres":[{"id":"23","description":"Indie"},{"id":"3","description":"RPG"},{"id":"2","description":"Strategy"}]}}}
