Excellent controls, imaginative and compelling level design, and plenty of belly laughs make this game worth going back to nearly 20 years later.”<br>8/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.pcinvasion.com/spongebob-squarepants-battle-for-bikini-bottom-rehydrated-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >PC Invasion</a><br><br>“A gorgeous remake of a cherished game adaptation. With tons of unlockables spread across levels with tons of variety, it doesn’t rely on its namesake alone to carry it. While SpongeBob fans will undoubtedly be happy to play through a game that retains the show’s sense of humor and colorful animation, its solid platforming and the freedom it provides players with to explore its diverse levels make it one of the better remakes we’ve seen.”<br>4/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.gamerevolution.com/review/650591-spongebob-squarepants-battle-for-bikini-bottom-rehydrated-review-ps4-switch-pc-xbox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Game Revolution</a><br><br>“The &quot;rehydrated&quot; version of Spongebob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom is an all-round entertainment product for a younger audience, who can take the opportunity to learn about the franchise, or on the other hand consolidate it with an original and fun adventure to play.
