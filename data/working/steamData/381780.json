It’s a story game adaptation of Around The World In 80 Days, and it’s accordingly full of exciting, exotic locations to visit, with capers to pull, revolutions to incite and derring-do to perform at many of them... 80 Days is the most human game I’ve ever played. It is also, simply put, one of the best games I’ve ever played.”<br><a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/10/12/80-days-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock Paper Shotgun</a><br>","header_image":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/381780/header.jpg?t=1572347689","website":"http://www.inklestudios.com/80days","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP+<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 2 Ghz with SSE2 instruction set support<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Hardware support for shader model 3<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 9.0c<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2 GB available space</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP+<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 4 Ghz with SSE2 instruction set support<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Intel Iris 6100 equivalent or better<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 9.0c<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> Present</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> OS X 10.7+<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 2 Ghz with SSE2 instruction set support<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> support for shader model 3<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2 GB available space</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> OS X 10.7+<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 4 Ghz with SSE2 instruction set support<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Intel Iris 6100 equivalent or better<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> Present</li></ul>"},"linux_requirements":[],"legal_notice":"© 2014 inkle Ltd","developers":["inkle Ltd","Cape Guy Ltd"],"price_overview":{"currency":"CAD","initial":1449,"final":1449,"discount_percent":0,"initial_formatted":"","final_formatted":"CDN$ 14.49"},"metacritic":{"score":84,"url":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/80-days-2015?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f"},"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"},{"id":22,"description":"Steam Achievements"},{"id":23,"description":"Steam Cloud"}],"genres":[{"id":"25","description":"Adventure"},{"id":"23","description":"Indie"},{"id":"2","description":"Strategy"}]}}}
