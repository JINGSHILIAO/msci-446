If played haphazardly it can be a wonderful farce rich with hilarious anecdotes, but played patiently and carefully it’s a horror game, a top-down voyage into the heart of darkness, an eternal raging fire I forever try but can only fail to douse.” RPS<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Prison Architect, to be sure, is an excellent game, worthy of comparison to its canonical inspirations, Dwarf Fortress and Bullfrog Productions’ 1990 construct-and-manage simulations. Few games can hope to match Prison Architect’s emergent storytelling, and fewer still can balance brutality and poignancy like it does.&quot; KILLSCREEN","header_image":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/233450/header.jpg?t=1643379730","website":"https://www.prisonarchitect.com/","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong>Windows 7<br>\t</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>Intel Core2 Duo 2.4Ghz or Higher / AMD 3Ghz or Higher<br>\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>6 GB RAM<br>\t</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>Nvidia 8600 / Radeon equivalent (2009 era)<br>\t</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong>400 MB HD space</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Processor:</strong>2009 era Macbook Pro, Core2 Duo processor<br>\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>6 GB RAM<br>\t</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong>400 MB HD space</li></ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Ubuntu 18 or later<br>\t</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core2 Duo 2.4Ghz or Higher / AMD 3Ghz or Higher<br>\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 6 GB RAM<br>\t</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Nvidia 8600 / Radeon equivalent (2009 era)<br>\t</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 500 MB HD space</li></ul>"},"legal_notice":"© 2020 Paradox Interactive AB, PRISON ARCHITECT and PARADOX INTERACTIVE are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of Paradox Interactive AB in Europe, the U.S., and other countries.
