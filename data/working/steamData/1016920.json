If possible, play with the same person so that you can grow together as a team. Also the soundtrack is really great.”<br><a href=\"https://twitter.com/concernedape\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >ConcernedApe</a><br>","header_image":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1016920/header.jpg?t=1644307357","website":"https://unrailed-game.com","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 2 GHz Dual Core<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Intel HD Graphics 520<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> </li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> <br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> <br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> <br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> </li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> macOS Mojave<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 2 GHz Dual Core<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Intel HD Graphics 5000<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Only wireless gamepads are supported.</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li></ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Ubuntu 18.04<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 2 GHz Dual Core<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Intel HD Graphics 520<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2 GB available space</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li></ul>"},"legal_notice":"©2019 Daedalic Entertainment GmbH and Indoor Astronaut GmbH.
