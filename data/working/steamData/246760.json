It tries to do something I've never seen before, putting a focus on story, quest structure, as well as choice and consequence, which one almost always associates with a classical role playing game. It combines this with the game play of a turn based strategy game.”<br>4/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.rpgwatch.com/articles/legends-of-eisenwald-review-349.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >RPGWatch</a><br><br>“The combat system of the game is very different from what the genre normally offers, and there are moments when its bloody results and focus on placement and movement makes it feel revolutionary.”<br>80/100 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.softpedia.com/reviews/games/pc/legends-of-eisenwald-review-485927.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Softpedia</a><br><br>“Legends of Eisenwald is both a unique and quality game in a sea of clones, rehashes, and titles that disappoint.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://syncaine.com/2015/07/18/legends-of-eisenwald-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Hardcore Casual</a><br>","header_image":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/246760/header.jpg?t=1634565149","website":"http://legendsofeisenwald.com","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> х64: XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 2 GHz dual-core CPU<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> 1024 MB graphics memory, shader model 3 (Radeon HD 6670, GeForce GT 630)<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 9.0c<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Screen resolution 1280x1024; Dedicated video card required</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> х64: XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 3 GHz quad-core CPU<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 6 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> 1024 MB graphics memory, shader model 3 (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 / AMD Radeon HD 6950 or better)<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 9.0c<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Screen resolution 1680x1050 or higher; Dedicated video card required</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"developers":["Aterdux Entertainment"],"price_overview":{"currency":"CAD","initial":2199,"final":2199,"discount_percent":0,"initial_formatted":"","final_formatted":"CDN$ 21.99"},"metacritic":{"score":71,"url":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/legends-of-eisenwald?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f"},"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"},{"id":22,"description":"Steam Achievements"},{"id":29,"description":"Steam Trading Cards"},{"id":30,"description":"Steam Workshop"},{"id":23,"description":"Steam Cloud"},{"id":17,"description":"Includes level editor"}],"genres":[{"id":"25","description":"Adventure"},{"id":"23","description":"Indie"},{"id":"3","description":"RPG"},{"id":"2","description":"Strategy"}]}}}
