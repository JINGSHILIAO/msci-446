I had the privilege to play a few hours with the alpha version and came away, for the most part, pleased. The game plays very similar to a more expansive version of Binding of Isaac, but instead of using a keyboard to shoot projectiles, players utilize a mouse. The magic shooting feels very smooth and intuitive. The pace of the combat is fairly fast and, at times, can turn into a bullet hell very quickly.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2013/07/23/full-mojo-rampage-could-be-the-next-great-rogue-like/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >HardcoreGamer</a><br><br>“Its already really solid, its got a lot of good content even tough its only in alpha...”<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPGQkrJmZTI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Total Biscuit - The Cynical Brit</a><br><br>“The alpha is surprisingly polished, mostly lacking in content and minor tweaks.
