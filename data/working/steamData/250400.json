With its mix of Diablo-esque hack and slash and dual-stick shooter action, 505 Games' newest Xbox Live Arcade game is a real surprise. It has a deep crafting system and a world you can't help but want to explore. How To Survive rewrites the book on zombie RPGs!”<br>90% – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/How-To-Survive/Item4212.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gaming Nexus</a><br><br>“While there have been several games that have recently released that fall into the growing zombie survival genre, How to Survive manages to do enough differently to earn its place among the crowd. The game’s strong emphasis on crafting and juggling basic human needs helps distinguish itself from other titles. Additionally, the story campaign features a tale that manages to contain a few plot twists despite its simplicity. One area where How to Survive shines is the game’s strange brand of humor which is helped along by the title’s decent voice acting. In all, How to Survive is recommended to any fans of either the undead or survival simulators. Those who enjoy intricate crafting or top-down gaming should also give it a look.”<br>4 Stars – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.examiner.com/review/how-to-survive-combines-a-zombie-outbreak-with-crafting-ingenuity?cid=rss&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Examiner</a><br><br>“In terms of graphic and sound design, How to Survive looks good and sounds even better. The lighting gives real-time shadows based on not only the source but the time of day as the shadows move with the passing sunlight. The island is beautifully rendered, and animations are fluid and zombie deaths are pleasingly gory, chunks of body parts will liter the ground and roll depending on the shape of the surface”<br>8/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://gamerhorizon.com/how-to-survive-review-what-lies-beneath/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gamer Horizon</a><br>","header_image":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/250400/header.jpg?t=1570016597","website":"http://www.howtosurvivethegame.com","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core 2 Duo or better<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Ati 5700 series/NVIDIA GeForce GT240 or equivalent<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 7 GB available space</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"legal_notice":"©Eko Software 2013.
