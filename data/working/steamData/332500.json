Both Melee and Shooting are the tools of death in GRAV.<br><br><strong>Player vs Player</strong> - Create alliances with other players, viciously kill them and take their belongings, or run from it all!  It's up to you how you interact with your fellow players.<br><br><strong>Play With Friends</strong> - GRAV is all about enjoying the experience with your friends. GRAV is client-server based so put up a server or join an official one!<br><br><strong>Powerful Base Construction</strong> - Supporting a modular contextual room based construction system allows for building bases quickly.  GRAV's building system can be used for creating an entire city, a quick base to fight off enemy players, or building an outpost deep in a dungeon to defend against the aggressive hordes. <br><br><strong>Extensive Crafting</strong> - Anything you can harvest or kill has a chance to drop Crafting Materials.  Building everything from the armor you wear, weapons you kill with, to the actual bases themselves comes from crafting.<br><br><strong>Dynamic Environmental Events</strong> - GRAV employs a procedural system to create world events for players.  A night could consist of blossoming night flowers, meteors raining down from the heavens, or even a horde of very angry alien wildlife trying to kill you and anything you have ever made. <br><br><strong>Procedurally Generated Dungeons</strong> - The planets of GRAV are full of dungeons that are created specifically for that planet.  Full of rare resources, dangerous foes, and environmental obstacles that provide a high-risk high-reward play area.<br><br><strong>Hostile Environments</strong> - Alien planets have a combination of semi safe areas and just plain you-are-probably-going to die locations!
