Then he suddenly remembers all the good times he had as a kid, playing his trusted 8-bit console.

He plugs in the cartridge right away, and get sucked into a vivid, but decaying world of platforming. And this is where your adventure takes off. <br><br>8BitBoy is the platformer I always dreamt about playing as a kid. <br><br>It's a fantastic mash-up of the greatest of the late 80's and 90's and a complete game on it's own terms. This is a true tribute to old school gaming and by no means a walk in the park, but it's also never unfair. With big challenges, the sense of accomplishment is always bigger and better. <br><br>To me, 8BitBoy is the ultimate classic platformer on PC and Mac. and a symbol of my love and passion for gaming. <br><br>Yours Sincerely,<br>Rasmus Kønig Sørensen<br>Indie developer and sole creator of 8BitBoy<br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/296910/extras/615logo_alt3.png?t=1621505818\" />","about_the_game":"<strong>Big classic platformer with tons of power-ups and 12+ hours of main story &amp; 300+ hidden locations just begging for exploration. 8BitBoy is a tribute to all the greatest platformers of the 80s and 90s and a symbol of my endless love and passion for gaming.</strong><br><br><strong><br>· 8-12 hours main story!<br>· 56 Levels + huge 5 Worlds<br>· 300+ Hidden Locations!<br>· Hidden Warp zones!<br>· Coin collecting game + tons of Power-Ups<br>· Boss-battles<br>· 60 fps frame rate (GPU dependent)</strong><br><br><u>Appropriate for all ages </u><br><br><i>* Full Xbox 360 Controller Support<br>(Auto switch - push button A to enable)</i><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/296910/extras/x360.png?t=1621505818\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Who's 8BitBoy?</h2>   <br><br>8BitBoy is out of a job, and quite frankly he's depressed about it.
