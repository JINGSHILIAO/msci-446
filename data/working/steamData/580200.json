And that’s not really a phrase that can be used too often in gaming, making it enormously worth celebrating here.”<br>RPS Recommended – <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/07/20/yonder-the-cloud-catcher-chronicles-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock Paper Shotgun</a><br><br>“The art and music are beautiful, and the lack of the combat in the game makes exploring Gemea a restful experience.
