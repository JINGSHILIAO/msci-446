Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order makes up for a lot of lost time with a fantastic single-player action-adventure that marks the return of the playable Jedi.”<br>9/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://t.co/jROEiy4ewg?amp=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >IGN</a><br><br>“Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is the ideal example of a Star Wars game in 2019. It’s an expert blend of multiple genres. It has characters that you love spending time with. It has the deeply attractive design aesthetic of the movies.  But Fallen Order is more than just “a good Star Wars game.” Respawn has made one of the best 3D Metroidvania games ever. And it’s among the best Souls-like games as well.  It is the kind of achievement that is only possible when one of the best developers in the world puts all of its might into making something special. And I hope we get more just like it in the future.”<br>93/100 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/14/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-a-series-defining-adventure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GamesBeat</a><br>","header_image":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1172380/header.jpg?t=1614960636","website":null,"pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> 64-bit Windows 7/8.1/10<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> AMD FX-6100/Intel i3-3220 or Equivalent<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 8 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> AMD Radeon HD 7750, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 or Equivalent<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 55 GB available space</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> 64-bit Windows 7/8.1/10<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> AMD Ryzen 7 1700/Intel  i7-6700K or Equivalent<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> AMD RX Vega 56, Nvidia GTX 1070/GTX1660Ti or Equivalent<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 55 GB available space</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li></ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li></ul>"},"legal_notice":"Germany, Austria, and Switzerland only: EA’S PRIVACY & COOKIE POLICY (<a href=\"http://privacy.ea.com/de\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >http://privacy.ea.com/de</a>) APPLIES.<br>Other EU, United Kingdom, Norway, Iceland,  Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia (FYROM), Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, San Marino, Serbia, Turkey, Vatican City (Holy See), Liechtenstein only: ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF EA's PRIVACY & COOKIE POLICY (<a href=\"http://privacy.ea.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >http://privacy.ea.com</a>) REQUIRED TO PLAY.<br>All other residents: ACCEPTANCE OF EA PRIVACY & COOKIE POLICY (<a href=\"http://privacy.ea.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >http://privacy.ea.com</a>) REQUIRED TO PLAY.<br><br>INTERNET CONNECTION; EA ACCOUNT; STEAM ACCOUNT; ACCEPTANCE OF EA USER AGREEMENT (<a href=\"http://terms.ea.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >http://terms.ea.com</a>) & ORIGIN END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (<a href=\"http://ea.com/legal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >http://ea.com/legal</a>); AND DOWNLOAD & INSTALLATION OF THE ORIGIN CLIENT SOFTWARE (<a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://origin.com/download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://origin.com/download</a>) REQUIRED TO PLAY.
