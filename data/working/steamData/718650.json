The lack of micromanagement also lets you concentrate on casting magic spells. You can fireball bridges and then steal islands from other factions, or carve up an enemy force with a lightning storm, or a tornado, or both. It's an odd mashup of Populus, Dungeon Keeper and Warcraft in a colourful setting”<br><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/build-a-beautiful-empire-of-floating-islands-in-driftlands/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >PC Gamer</a><br><br>“I had a good time with the floating islands of Driftland, and its indirect control scheme is well compensated by a great AI and a smooth UI. After an adjustment period, I saw how this game could be very relaxing while keeping a tight control on the flow of a huge empire.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://saveorquit.com/2019/06/29/review-driftland-the-magic-revival/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >SAVE or QUIT</a><br>","header_image":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/718650/header.jpg?t=1635260074","website":"https://stardrifters.com/driftland","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> 64-bit Windows 7<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> AMD Ryzen 3 or Intel Core i3 (3 Ghz)<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> AMD Radeon 7970 or NVIDIA GeForce 770 or or equivalent DirectX 11 card<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 5 GB available space</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> 64-bit Windows 10<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> AMD Ryzen 5 or Intel Core i5 (3 Ghz)<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 8 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> AMD Radeon RX 480 or NVIDIA GeForce 1060 or or equivalent DirectX 11 card<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 5 GB available space</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> 10.13 (High Sierra) or newer<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> AMD Ryzen 3 or Intel Core i3 (3 Ghz)<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GPU 2GB Video Ram<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 5 GB available space</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> 10.13 (High Sierra) or newer<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> AMD Ryzen 5 or Intel Core i5 (3 Ghz)<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 8 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GPU 4GB Video Ram<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 5 GB available space</li></ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li></ul>"},"legal_notice":"©2020 Star Drifters Sp. z o.o.
