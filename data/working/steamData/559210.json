It’s thoughtful, beautiful, sad and funny. It presents itself as a childlike narrative game, but it offers unsettling and affirming truths about the way we live. I feel privileged to have spent time with its characters, with their weaknesses and their strengths. This is an extraordinary game.”<br>9.5/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/12/15632474/rakuen-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Polygon</a><br><br>“And after completing the game, I truly do feel it's a creative masterpiece.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.indieobscura.com/article/1199/rakuen-review---a-world-of-warmth-and-sorrow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Indie Obscura</a><br><br>“The result is something enchanting.
