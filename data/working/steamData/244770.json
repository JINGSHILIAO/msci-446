Equip your ships with completely customisable weapons and conquer the galaxy. Trade and make a fortune, mass produce materials in gigantic factories. Design your very own space station. Create warp gates and network the universe at your front door. <br><br>The universe is a vast, mystical, beautiful, awe-inspiring place.... the universe is yours.<br><br>Built for scalability to facilitate massive fully interactable objects, almost anything is possible. Gameplay elements have been skillfully constructed to bring the ultimate space sandbox experience. <br><br>Dive into your own unique universe, and choose your path.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Procedurally generated infinite universe, with quadrillions of galaxies</strong> - The universe is massive.
