It’s not. This is a project filled with incredibly smart puzzle design and an important message at its core. Anyone who absentmindedly picked it up during a sale should do themselves a favor and play right now. If you don’t yet own it, then definitely consider making a purchase in the near future. Nihilumbra is a thoroughly enjoyable experience that will stick with you. (4.5/5)”<br>9 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2013/12/07/review-nihilumbra/64848/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2013/12/07/review-nihilumbra/64848/</a><br><br>“The whole game is great, but for me the presentation takes Nihilumbra from being a fun and clever indie game to something really special. Its presentation rivals games like Braid and Limbo. Everything looks hand drawn and a bit ethereal, a mix between a Tim Burton movie and a Jhonen Vasquez comic. The visuals are complemented by an orchestral score that’s just Danny Elfman enough, and narration that is very well voiced for the story. The tone of the game is serious, and the presentation really supports that rather than undermining it and making it come off as silly.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2013/09/23/4cr-plays-nihilumbra/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2013/09/23/4cr-plays-nihilumbra/</a><br><br>“Nihilumbra shines brightest here (Void Mode). Where the story merely hints at the potential of behind its mechanics, Void Mode demonstrates their genius. It brings out Nihilumbra’s best levels, testing your mettle while retaining the game’s penchant for easily understood puzzles. The mode tests you without employing opaque logic, making you reexamine how you approach problem solving. Plus, there’s even a couple story hooks that bring some additional closure, thus sweetening the deal.
