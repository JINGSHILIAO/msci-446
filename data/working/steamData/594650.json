DIE ALONE.</strong></u><br> <br>The year is 1895, and you are a Hunter tasked with eliminating the savage, nightmarish monsters that have infested the Louisiana Bayou. Play alone or in teams of two or three, as you search for clues to help you track your target and compete against other Hunters who are after the same reward. Kill and banish your target, collect the bounty, and then get ready for the showdown; once the bounty is in your hands every other Hunter on the map will be after your prize.
