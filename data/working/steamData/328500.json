By making old obstacles suddenly seem impossible, it shows the player what it feels like to surrender oneself to encroaching inevitability, to just give up and embrace what’s coming.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.puresophistry.com/2013/01/28/potatoman-sought-the-troof-i-didnt-get-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Pure Sophistry</a><br><br>“Potatoman Seeks the Troof is an experience well worth having.
