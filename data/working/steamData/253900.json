Apart from the purely fictitious geography of our world, all game elements and scenes are based on the Anglo-Saxon period, 1200 A.D.

A conspiracy against the king catapults the captain into a situation where he finds himself responsible for the defence of the last royal province. This is all that remains of the shattered kingdom, which has been split into numerous small principalities and fiefdoms. And now even the king himself, ensconced in his capital, is threatened by enemy armies. This is the starting point of your Middle Ages adventure. Now you must win back all those provinces which once belonged to your king.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THE SHATTERED KINGDOM:</strong></h2>After many battles, a former kingdom has been divided into many small principalities and earldoms. The kingís troops were pushed back into one last royal province, and the rulers of the other provinces waged terrible, destructive wars against one another.
