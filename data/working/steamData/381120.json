Stop Thieves quickly, with a swing of your sword or a zap of a lightning spell! (Or maybe both, if you’re really bloodthirsty.) Price your wares competitively and great adventurers will travel from miles away to your one-stop shop to spend their gold – the gold that they probably found conveniently placed on a cave floor! Shoppe Keep delivers deep gameplay mechanics in a memorable, tongue-in-cheek world.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/381120/extras/ShoppeKeepHeader.png?t=1645007873\" /><br>Gone are the days of testing the theoretical water – we’re now a fully-fledged, fully-opened store!

What complete rubbish! Additional tables can be purchased by speaking with the innkeeper, as well as additional upgrades that will help your Inn deliver serious coin. Adventurers traveling through town might want to visit the Inn and enjoy some food and ale – if they haven’t found some randomly laying around on their travels already. We all know that fantasy worlds cater for their heroes – but with Shoppe Keep, you’ll be able to make sure that catering doesn’t equal ‘potato in a toilet’!<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/381120/extras/Classes.png?t=1645007873\" /><br>Various members of four completely original and never before seen character classes will visit your store, including hardened warriors, magical mages, sneaky rogues and wise druids.
