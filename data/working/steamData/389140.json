Of all of the retro revival games that have come out over the past few years, it is near the top of my personal list of favourites. I can’t get enough of it... there is a real addicting 'one more race' quality to the game.”<br>8.5/10 – <a href=\"https://www.destructoid.com/review-horizon-chase-turbo-513460.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Destructoid</a><br><br>“The best arcade-inspired racing game since Outrun 2006: Coast 2 Coast over a decade ago. Horizon Chase Turbo wears its Outrun influences proudly and offers up the same kind of pick up and play thrills, but with more content to sink your teeth into.”<br>4/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.hardcoregamer.com/2018/05/15/review-horizon-chase-turbo/299122/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Hardcore Gamer</a><br><br>“From the looks of things, Horizon Chase Turbo nails the look and sound of this very specific era of racing games (early 90s). Gradient-heavy backdrops, track-side objects whizzing past at improbable speeds, and crashes merely slowing your car as it pirouettes through the air, before allowing you to resume your dash to the finish line.”<br><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/05/16/horizon-chase-turbo-retro-racing-game-steam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock Paper Shotgun</a><br>","header_image":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/389140/header.jpg?t=1636137433","website":"http://www.horizonchaseturbo.com/","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7 or newer<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core 2 Duo 2.0 GHz or better<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Intel HD Graphics 4000 or better<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 9.0c<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 800 MB available space</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7 or newer<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i5 2.5 GHz or better<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GeForce 8000 Series or better<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 9.0c<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 1 GB available space</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> 10.11 El Capitan<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core 2 Duo 2.0 GHZ or better<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Intel HD Graphics 4000 or better<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 800 MB available space</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> 10.13 High Sierra<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i5 2.5 GHz or better<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GeForce 8000 Series or better<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 1 GB available space</li></ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Linux Ubuntu 16.04 or newer<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core 2 Duo 2.0 GHZ or better<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Intel HD Graphics 4000 or better<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 800 MB available space</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Linux Ubuntu 16.04 or newer<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i5 2.5 GHz or better<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GeForce 8000 Series or better<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 1 GB available space</li></ul>"},"legal_notice":"©2021 Aquiris Game Studio.
