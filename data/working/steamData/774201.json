Award-winning narrative adventure game with hieroglyphic language puzzles, from the creators of 80 DAYS.","supported_languages":"English<strong>*</strong><br><strong>*</strong>languages with full audio support","reviews":"“Heaven's Vault is a piece of interactive storytelling that drops you into a dense mesh of narrative choices. The whole thing's as intricate and inter-connected, perhaps, as one of the tiled abstract patterns that decorate the walls and doorways of the game's Middle-Eastern and North-African-inspired environments... This thing is a wonder.”<br>Recommended – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-04-16-heavens-vault-review-a-rich-web-of-possibility\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Eurogamer</a><br><br>“This science fiction adventure is a very exciting thing indeed. It’s a game about exploring the past, in the future, through archaeology and translation, and it has a remarkable sense of wonder... What Inkle have achieved in Heaven’s Vault is tremendous. I don’t know what to compare it to, because there isn’t anything.”<br><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/03/07/inkles-heavens-vault-a-stunning-sci-fi-archaeology-adventure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a><br><br>“Exquisite...
